# Laravel Resources Directory

The resources directory contains all of your frontend assets like views, CSS, and JavaScript. It's where you define how your application looks and how users interact with it.

## Directory Structure

- `resources/views`: Contains Blade templates that render HTML
- `resources/css`: Contains CSS stylesheets, often using frameworks like Tailwind
- `resources/js`: Contains JavaScript files that provide client-side interactivity

## Key Concepts

### Views (Blade Templates)
- Located in `resources/views`
- Use Laravel's Blade templating engine
- Files end with `.blade.php` extension
- Can extend layouts and include partials
- Convert PHP variables into HTML markup

### CSS and JavaScript
- Located in `resources/css` and `resources/js`
- Compiled using Vite (defined in vite.config.js)
- Entry points are defined in vite.config.js
- Use `@vite` directive in Blade templates to include compiled assets

### Asset Compilation
- Vite processes these files into optimized assets for production
- CSS can use preprocessors like Sass or PostCSS
- JavaScript can use modern ES features and be bundled
- Final compiled assets are stored in `public/build`

### Tailwind CSS
- Laravel 12 includes Tailwind CSS by default
- Configuration typically in `tailwind.config.js`
- Use utility classes in your Blade templates
