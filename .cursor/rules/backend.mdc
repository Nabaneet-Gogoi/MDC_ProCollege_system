## Notes
- The system focuses on college management, funding, and construction progress tracking
- Funding is allocated to colleges based on their type and phase:
  - MDC Phase 1: 8 crores (Central:State = 50:50)
  - MDC Phase 2: 12 crores (Central:State = 90:10)
  - Professional: 26 crores (Central:State = 90:10)
- Fund releases are tracked against funding allocations with remaining balance calculations
- Bills are submitted by colleges for construction work and require admin approval
- Physical progress of construction is tracked separately from bills
- Work is categorized (e.g., foundation, walls, roof) for detailed progress tracking
- Bill progress tracks work reported with each bill submission
- Physical progress tracks the actual construction progress verified on site
- All tables use appropriate indexes for optimized queries
- Users can have either 'college' or 'RUSA' roles, with college users linked to a specific college
- The admin table includes a default admin user created during migration
